You are given final data from a technical interview.

Vacancy info:
{vacancy_info}

Numeric platform metrics (MetricsBlock1):
{metrics_block1}

Intermediate evaluation metrics (MetricsBlock2):
{metrics_block2}

Full chat history between interviewer and candidate (oldest → newest):
{chat_history}

Use ALL of this information to produce a final high-level assessment of the candidate for this specific vacancy.

Your task:
- Describe the candidate’s main strengths.
- Describe the main weaknesses or gaps.
- Summarize whether there are signs of cheating or suspicious behavior.
- Make a rough seniority guess.
- Give a final hiring recommendation.

Follow these rules:
- Use Russian for all text fields, unless the majority of the chat is in English. If the chat is mostly in English, write all text fields in English.
- Do NOT describe internal metrics or system details in the text.
- For cheating, use only:
  - the numeric field "copy_paste_suspicion" from MetricsBlock1, and
  - clear evidence from the chat (e.g. explicit mentions of copying, external tools).
  If evidence is weak or unclear, say that directly and avoid strong accusations.

Field constraints:
- "seniority_guess" must be exactly one of:
  - "junior"
  - "middle"
  - "senior"

- "recommendation" must be exactly one of:
  - "reject"
  - "doubt"
  - "hire"
  - "strong_hire"

Return ONLY a single JSON object with exactly these fields and no others:
- "strengths"
- "weaknesses"
- "cheating_summary"
- "seniority_guess"
- "recommendation"
