You are given data from a completed or ongoing technical interview.

Vacancy info:
{vacancy_info}

Numeric platform metrics (MetricsBlock1):
{metrics_block1}

Full chat history between interviewer and candidate (oldest → newest):
{chat_history}

Use ALL of this information to evaluate how clearly and completely the candidate answered questions and how well they fit the technical requirements of this vacancy.

Your task:
- Produce a short internal summary of the interview.
- Assign clarity and completeness scores from 0 to 5 (integers).
- Give a short message about how well the candidate used hints from the interviewer.
- Evaluate overall technical fit for the job as ("low", "medium", or "high") and explain why.

Follow these rules:
- Use Russian for all text fields, unless the majority of the chat is in English. If the chat is mostly in English, write all text fields in English.
- Do NOT describe internal metrics or system details in the text.
- Do NOT accuse the candidate of cheating unless this is clearly supported by the numeric metrics and by obvious evidence in the chat.
- If the candidate gave almost no answers or only irrelevant messages, use 0 or 1 for clarity/completeness and explain that in the summary.

Return ONLY a single JSON object with exactly these fields and no others:
- "summary"
- "clarity_score"
- "completeness_score"
- "feedback_response"
- "tech_fit_level"
- "tech_fit_comment"
